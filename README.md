<h1>Nablus Municipality Water Reporting Android Application</h1>

<h2>About The Application</h2>
<p>This application was developed as my first mobile app for the Municipality of Nablus to help people report water problems using their android application, 
This application development is part of an ICMA NGO App2Action program to improve Nablus Municipality Reporting Facility, and I won the best idea to get the fund to develop the app.
Notice that the application is removed from the play store after one year by the Municipality for reasons out of my responsibility or authority.

<h2>Screenshots Of The App</h2>
<p>Notice this is a screenshots of fake reports during development, for privacy reasons I could not take screenshots of
real users report, also the design is not great because I was very new to UI development in that time comparing to the experience I have
right now Check out my Gayelak-iOS repo to see my current experience in UI development.
